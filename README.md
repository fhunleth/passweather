# passweather

This repository mirrors the source zip file for the [Build a Weather Station with Elixir and Nerves](https://pragprog.com/titles/passweather/build-a-weather-station-with-elixir-and-nerves/)
book with some updates to the Nerves project. Specifically, it updates several
dependencies so that it's easier to run. This was done quickly with minimal
testing. For questions, please post to the [Elixir
Forum](https://elixirforum.com) or feel free to make a PR for small fixes.
Please don't send feature enhancements.
